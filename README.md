# RingTopologyJava

This is a Java application that simulates a ring communication topology and using sockets and three instances. Each instance receives information from the node behind it and sends information to the next node. The action starts when a number is entered in the console/cmd, and one of the instances receives the number, increments it, and sends it forward. This process continues until the value reaches >= 100.
